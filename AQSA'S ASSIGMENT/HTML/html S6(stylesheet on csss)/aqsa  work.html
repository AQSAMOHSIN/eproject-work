<h1>ICC Champions Trophy</h1>
<p ><i>The ICC conceived the idea of the Champions Trophy - a short cricket tournament to raise funds for the development of the game in non-test playing countries, with the first tournaments being held in Bangladesh and Kenya.[4] Due to its massive commercial success[5], the tournament has been held in nations like India and England as a revenue generator for the ICC, and the number of teams has been reduced to eight. The tournament, later dubbed as the mini-World Cup as it involved all of the full members of the ICC, was planned as a knock-out tournament so that it was short and did not reduce the value and importance of the World Cup. However, from 2002, the tournament has had a round-robin format, followed by few knockout games but the tournament still takes places over a short period of time - about two weeks</i>.</p>
